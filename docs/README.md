# $SUDO SDK

$SUDO is an innovative protocol that enables AI to safely execute computer-level tasks in a controlled and secure environment. This SDK provides developers with tools to integrate $SUDO's capabilities into their applications, ensuring that tasks are executed according to security policies, with robust orchestration, container management, and blockchain integration.

## Introduction

The $SUDO protocol is designed to empower AI to perform computer-level tasks securely and efficiently. The SDK offers key features such as:

- **Orchestration**: AI-driven task execution across various isolated environments.
- **Container Management**: Secure execution of commands and scripts in isolated containers.
- **Blockchain Integration**: On-chain logging and governance using the $SUDO token.
- **Policy Engine**: Enforces security policies, controlling which operations are allowed or denied.

By using the $SUDO SDK, developers can integrate AI task execution in their applications while ensuring that it follows predefined security policies.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get the SDK set up and running in your development environment:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (if you want to containerize your environment)
- $SUDO token (if integrating with the blockchain)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sudo-sdk.git
   cd sudo-sdk
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   Make sure you have Python 3.8+ installed and then run:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file or configure environment variables as needed for your deployment. For example:
   ```bash
   export SUDO_API_URL="https://api.sudo.com"
   export SUDO_TOKEN="your-sudo-token"
   ```

## How It Works

The $SUDO SDK provides a secure AI environment where commands can be orchestrated and executed inside isolated containers. Here’s an overview of the workflow:

1. **User Prompt**: The user submits a task to the AI.
2. **Orchestrator**: The orchestrator evaluates the task and determines the appropriate actions.
3. **Container Execution**: The task is executed inside a secure container or virtual machine.
4. **Results**: The results are returned, and logs are stored, potentially on the blockchain for auditability.

---

## Usage

Once the SDK is set up, you can start using it by importing the core modules and executing tasks in a secure environment.

Here’s a minimal example of using the SDK:

```python
from sudo_sdk.orchestrator import SudoOrchestrator
from sudo_sdk.container_manager import ContainerManager

# Create an orchestrator instance
orchestrator = SudoOrchestrator()

# Run a simple task in a container
result = orchestrator.execute_task('create_file', params={"file_name": "test.txt"})

print(f"Task Result: {result}")
```

## $SUDO Token

The $SUDO token plays a central role in the ecosystem. It can be used for various purposes:

- **Governance**: Token holders can participate in governance decisions for protocol upgrades and security policy settings.
- **On-Chain Logging**: All task executions and results can be logged on the blockchain for transparency and auditability.
- **Token Integration**: If using blockchain features, the SDK will interact with the $SUDO token to ensure tasks are securely verified and logged.

---

## Running the SDK Locally

To run the SDK locally, you can use Docker for easy setup and containerization.

### Using Docker

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t sudo-sdk .
   ```

2. **Run the container**:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 5000:5000 sudo-sdk
   ```

3. **Test the SDK locally**:
   With the SDK running inside a container, you can interact with it through its API or via the Python SDK.
